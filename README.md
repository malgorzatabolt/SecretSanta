You can input details about your event, such as the location, time, and the maximum price for gifts. Additionally, you have the option to add participants.
After reviewing the entered information, the program randomly selects which participant should give a gift to whom and then sends them an email notification.

Bootstrap 5 was utilized for the front-end and and styling.
SQLAlchemy was employed for database operations. 
Wtforms was used to handle forms.
